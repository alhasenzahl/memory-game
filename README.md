## Instructions

This game is played just like the childhood classic card game, Memory.  The goal of the game is to find all of the matching cards by flipping the cards over two at a time.  If the two you flip over are a match, they will remain flipped over for the remainder of the game.  However, if they do not match, then they will be flipped back over and you can try again by clicking on two new cards.  Once all of the cards have been matched, the game is over and you will be shown your score and be given the option to play again.  At the start of every game the cards are reshuffled and the timer and scoring is reset.

## Dependencies

The only dependencies for this game are the two font links in the header of the index.html file.  One is for the type font and the other is for the icons shown on the cards.  There is a fallback font for the text if you don't have access to the specified font.
